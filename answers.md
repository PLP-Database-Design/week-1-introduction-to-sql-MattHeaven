1. DBMS Components:
- Hardware: Physical computing and storage infrastructure 
- Software: Database management programs
- Data: Stored information
- Procedures: Usage guidelines and protocols
- Query Language: Interface for data manipulation
- People: Users and administrators

2. Relational Database: 
A database organized in tables with relationships between them through common fields.
Examples:
- MySQL
- Oracle
- PostgreSQL 
- Microsoft SQL Server

3. SQL Classifications:
- DDL: Creates and modifies database structure (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)
- DML: Manipulates data (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- DCL: Controls access rights (GRANT, REVOKE)

4. Primary vs Foreign Key:
Primary Key uniquely identifies records within a table. Foreign Key references a Primary Key in another table to establish relationships.

5. Entity-Relationship Diagram:
Visual representation of database tables and their relationships using standardized symbols and connectors.

6. Advantages of Relational Databases:
- Data independence
- Elimination of redundancy 
- Data integrity
- Multi-user access
- Complex query capability
- Backup/recovery features

7. Data Types:
- INTEGER
- VARCHAR
- DATE
- DECIMAL

8. DBMS Purpose:
- Organizes and manages data
- Ensures data security
- Maintains data integrity
- Enables data sharing
- Handles backup/recovery
- Controls concurrent access
